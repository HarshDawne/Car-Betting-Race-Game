# 🚗 Car Racing Betting Game – Python + Turtle

This is a **fun and visual car racing game** developed in **Python** using the `turtle` and `tkinter` modules. The game allows users to place a **bet** on which car (color) will win the race. The race outcome is determined randomly each time, keeping the excitement fresh and unpredictable!

---

## 🧠 Game Logic

- Five cars (Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Black) race across the screen.
- The user places a **bet** on their favorite car by entering a color name.
- Each car moves forward in small random steps.
- The first car to cross the finish line wins.
- A **popup window** declares the winner and whether the player has won or lost.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Modules Used**:
  - `turtle` – for car graphics and movement
  - `tkinter` – for input and popup dialogs
